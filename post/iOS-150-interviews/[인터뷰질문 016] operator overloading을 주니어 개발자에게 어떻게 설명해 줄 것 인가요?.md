# [인터뷰질문 016] operator overloading을 주니어 개발자에게 어떻게 설명해 줄 것 인가요?

Operator overloading sounds like a complex topic, but really you can and should boil this answer down as small as you can: it allows us to use the same + operator with multiple types, such as integers, strings, doubles, and more. If you want to talk about examples of custom operator overloading, perhaps think about multiplying a CGPoint or something else that’s easy to use in practice.
