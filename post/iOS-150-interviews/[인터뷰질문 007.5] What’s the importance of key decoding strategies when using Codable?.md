Suggested approach: Give a specific answer first – “key decoding strategies let us handle difference between JSON keys and property names in our Decodable struct” – then provide some kind of practical sample. For example, you might say that it’s common for JSON keys to use snake_case for key names, whereas in Swift we prefer camelCase, so we need to use a key decoding strategy to convert between the two.
