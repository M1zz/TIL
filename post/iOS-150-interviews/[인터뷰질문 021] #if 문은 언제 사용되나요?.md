Suggested approach: The syntax was added in Swift 2.2 to support compile-time version checking, meaning that you can mix two different Swift versions in one file without errors because only one will be used at a time.

Make sure and give an example, such as Swift 5.4 supporting colors such as .red.opacity(0.5) whereas older versions need to use Color.red.opacity(0.5).
