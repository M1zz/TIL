# [인터뷰질문 040] What is a variadic function?
관련주제 : Swift
난이도 : 중

Suggested approach: Variadic functions accept any number of parameters. Swift writes them using ..., and we’re handed the parameters as an array. Again, try to give an example – something like print() is a good place to start.

For bonus points, you could add that Swift 5.4 and later allow multiple variadic parameters.
