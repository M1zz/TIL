# [인터뷰질문 035] 새로운 Swift 개발자에게 클로저를 어떻게 설명하시겠습니까?

Suggested approach: Closures are easy to begin with, but make sure you talk about capturing of values, capture lists (unowned vs weak), and why they are actually useful compared to other approaches. It’s possible your interviewer is looking for a broader discussion of functions as first-class types in Swift, so if they seem to be waiting for you to continue that might be a good angle to go down.
